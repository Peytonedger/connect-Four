Discription: Connect four is a 1 on 1 skill game
Your goal is to get 4 of your color (yellow or red) in a row to win
I chose this game because it is something I fondly remember playing as a kid

this game was created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

Next steps:
 -I would like to be able to click anywhere on screen and have the tiles drop to the bottom.
 -I would also like to add chip placement audio when you place your chip.
 -I would like to add a win counter to keep track of how many wins each player has.
